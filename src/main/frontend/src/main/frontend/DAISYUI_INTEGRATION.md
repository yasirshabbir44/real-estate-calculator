# DaisyUI Integration Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the integration of DaisyUI, a component library for Tailwind CSS, into the Real Estate App. DaisyUI provides pre-built components that are fully customizable and enhance the application's visual appeal, user experience, and accessibility.

## What is DaisyUI?
DaisyUI is a plugin for Tailwind CSS that adds component classes to make UI development faster and easier. It provides:
- 40+ interactive components (buttons, cards, modals, etc.)
- Theme customization with semantic color names
- Dark mode support
- Responsive design
- Accessibility features

## Installation
DaisyUI has been added to the project as a dependency:

```bash
npm install daisyui --save
```

And configured in the `tailwind.config.js` file:

```js
module.exports = {
  // ... other Tailwind CSS configuration
  plugins: [require("daisyui")],
  daisyui: {
    themes: [
      {
        realestatelight: {
          // Light theme colors
        },
        realestateDark: {
          // Dark theme colors
        }
      }
    ],
    darkTheme: "realestateDark",
  },
}
```

## Theme Configuration
Two custom themes have been created to match the existing color scheme of the application:

1. **realestatelight** - The default light theme
2. **realestateDark** - A dark theme for dark mode support

The themes use the color values from the existing Tailwind configuration to ensure consistency with the current design.

## Dark Mode Support
Dark mode support has been added to the application using DaisyUI's theming system. The theme can be toggled using the theme toggle button in the navbar.

The theme is controlled by the `data-theme` attribute on the `<html>` element:

```html
<html lang="en" data-theme="realestatelight">
```

## Components Enhanced with DaisyUI

### Navbar
- Added a theme toggle button using DaisyUI's `btn`, `btn-circle`, `btn-sm`, and `btn-ghost` classes
- Added a theme toggle switch in the mobile menu using DaisyUI's `swap` component

### Home Page
- Enhanced the feature cards with DaisyUI's `card`, `card-body`, `card-title`, and `card-actions` classes
- Added a glass card to the Call to Action section using DaisyUI's `glass` class
- Updated buttons to use DaisyUI's button classes
